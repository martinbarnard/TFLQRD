# Brentford Market Place Bus display

## Why? 

The original one was nice, but I felt that there could be improvements in the javascript & html. Also, I wanted an example which used the bus timetable api.
It shows the next n-buses going towards Chiswick and away from Chiswick from a single bus stop 



## Customisation 

The following .getJSON:

```  $.getJSON("https://api.tfl.gov.uk/StopPoint/910GPCKHMQD/arrivals" ```

Can be customised to any TFL station, by changing the `910GPCKHMQD, the code can be found by searching this link 

``` https://tfl.gov.uk/travel-information/stations-stops-and-piers/ ``` 

and snipping the link of the result. For example, Caledonian Road's URL is

```https://tfl.gov.uk/overground/stop/910GCLDNNRB/caledonian-road-barnsbury-rail-station/?Input=Caledonian+Road+%26+Barnsbury+Rail+Station```

Thus it's unique identifier is 910GCLDNNRB. 


Enjoy!
